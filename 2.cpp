    in the orignal array but that will be time consuming 
    so we made an array that is PREFIX SUM ARRAY
    Now if you observe the sum of elements from l to r in the original array is
    equal to r index - (l-1) index element in the  modified PREFIX SUM ARRAY this
    observation i got when i wrote on a copy â—‹) i can't explain much but the observation was
    the sum is contained within the r index but we will have to get rid of the elements
    we dont need that means we will have to get rid of the sum of the elements before l
    that is contained within l-1
